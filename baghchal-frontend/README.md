# 📌 Bagh-Chal Game Frontend

The **Bagh-Chal Game Frontend** is the client-side application of a Database Management System (DBMS) project based on the traditional Nepali board game **Bagh-Chal**.  

It is built using **React** for creating interactive user interfaces, and **Tailwind CSS** for styling, ensuring a modern, responsive, and visually appealing design.  

The frontend provides an interactive experience where users can:
- Register and log in
- Start a new game
- Make tiger and goat moves
- View the move history and game progress

State management is handled using **React Hooks**, and API communication with the backend is done via **Fetch API** or **Axios**.  

This project is developed for academic purposes to demonstrate **frontend–backend–database integration** using modern web technologies.
