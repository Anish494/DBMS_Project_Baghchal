# 📌 Bagh-Chal Game Frontend

The Bagh-Chal Game Frontend is the client-side application of a Database Management System (DBMS) project based on the traditional Nepali board game **Bagh-Chal**.  
It provides an interactive interface for users to register, log in, start a game, make moves, and view game progress.

The frontend communicates with a Django backend through **REST APIs**.  
All game data is stored and managed in a **PostgreSQL** database via the backend using SQL-based operations.

This project is developed for academic purposes to demonstrate frontend–backend–database integration.
